# AGENTS.md - Lumninesa Design Guidelines

1. Please look at all MD documents in this folder when creating new components.
2. After initial creation please review the component to see if there were any preexisting components that could be used instead of creating a new one.
3. For items that you arent sure about please create a separate task for discussion and confirmation with the team.
Your help and expertise are invaluable to the FusionUI project. If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to the team.
